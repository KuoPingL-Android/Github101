Astroids.js

1.
When we fixed the bug, and do git status.
We should see that :
  modified : game.js

2.
When we also modified index.html
Let's take a look at what is happening in
Working Directory, Staging Area and Repository

- Repository :
  the repository contains several commits
  each commit contains several files

  In the most recent commit :
  - game.js
  - index.html

- Staging Area :
  the staging area is a copy of the most recent commit
  until changes are ADD to it.

- Working Directory :
  working directory also contains the same files, but modified:
  - game.js *
  - index.html *

Comparision GIT DIFF :
GIT DIFF <old id> <new id>
You can compare commits by id,
but you can't compare the ones in Stage Area and Work Directory

GIT DIFF
However, you can simply call git diff with no argument :

You will see the differences from both files

When you add game.js, git diff will only show index.html changes,
since Stage Area is now the same as working Directory.

game.js will disappear when committed.

How about comparing Stage Area and Latest Commit ?
GIT DIFF --STAGED

3.
Now I want to get rid of the changes in index.html :
git reset --hard
 - this will discard any changes in either the working directory
    or the staging area
