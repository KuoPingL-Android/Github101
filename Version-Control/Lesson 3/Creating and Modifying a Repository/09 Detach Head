In order to get the Detach "HEAD" message,
you need to checkout a COMMIT ... not a branch.

HEAD <~ means current commit.

=======================
If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, use
git checkout -b new_branch_name

Running git checkout -b new_branch_name is like running
2 commands at the same time :

~ git branch new_branch_name
~ git checkout new_branch_name
