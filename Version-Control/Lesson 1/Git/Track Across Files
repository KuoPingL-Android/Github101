Tracking Across Files
Example :
func A { call B() } in A.file
func B {//implement} in B.file

if you wish to add an additional argument to func B,
you will need to change  code in both files.


Non-code orientated VCS usually track 1 file at a time.
Meaning :
 if you changed both files, they will have separate version saved.

In the following examples, which do you think make more sense
to track both files simulataneously ?
- competition style coding : solve the problem in one page
- html / css
- photoshop
- novels with different chapters.

of course b.
