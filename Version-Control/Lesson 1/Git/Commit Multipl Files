WHAT IS REPOSITORY?
When working on projects, there might be files that you want to track together.

Git calls this collection of files REPOSITORY.

Repository == Set<Files that you wish to track together>


When Commiting :
Git will save a version of every files in the repository.

How to create a REPOSITORY with multiple files?
Simply commit them togehter.
Then, when you commit one of the files in the repository,
all other files will be tracked as well.

Example :
1st commit : game.js, index.html, index.css
2nd commit : game.js (index.html, index.css) <- these are from previous version.
