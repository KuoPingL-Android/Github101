How Often to Commit
 A good rule of thumb is to make one commit per logical change.

 For example, if you fixed a typo, then fixed a bug in a separate part
 of the file, you should use one commit for each change
 since they are logically separate.

Commit Size Quiz
   You commit all the changes required to add a new feature,
   which you’ve been working on for a week.
   You haven’t committed since you started working on it.

    - too big


    You find three typos in your README. You fix and commit the first.
    - too small

    You commit all the changes required to add a new feature,
    which you’ve been working on for an hour.
    - just right

    You fix two small bugs in different functions and commit them both at once.
    - too big


Reflection :
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing
when to create a commit, like you do in Git,
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
