Conflicting Collaboration

So far, we have only been looking at cases when two repositories are out
of sync. It has been about 1 repository having commits that the other doesn't.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
Example :
local : ac5 <- b3c (master)
remote : ac5 (master)
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

What if ...
They both have commits that are reachable from the same branch ?
What will happen when you pull or push ?

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
Example :
local : ac5 <- b3c
remote : ac5 <- df6

PULL :
pulling will set your state the same as remote

b3c <~ gone

So what should you do ?
git fetch origin
^
update all the local copies of every branch for the origin remote

then you can use git log and git diff to see the differences on
both the local and remote repositories.

When you are ready, you can use
git merge

this is what happen when you do a git pull

Simulate Sarah's Changes
In the Downloadables section,
there is a file called sarah_changes.sh,
which contains code to make it look like Sarah
has modified your fork on GitHub.

To run the code, download the file, then using
Git Bash or your terminal, cd to the directory where you've saved it.

Then type bash sarah_changes.sh followed by a space,
followed by the url to your fork.

For example, if Caroline were running the code,
she would type

bash sarah_changes.sh https://github.com/cbuckey-uda/recipes.git,

but you should use the url for your fork,
not Caroline's fork.

If you haven't set up password caching,
then you will be prompted to enter your GitHub username and password.


So here's the process :
1.
You Fork Larry's code, with the latest commit
  - "Add chili recipe"

2.
git clone to your computer :
"Add Chili Recipe" (origin/master)

3.
modified "New Recipe"

"Add Chili Recipe" <- "New Recipe" (master)
^
(origin/master)

4.
Sarah modified on GitHub "Remove cumin"
Her repository :

"Add Chili Recipe" (origin/master) <- "Remove cumin" (master)

5.
git fetch
"Add Chili Recipe" <- "New Recipe" (master)
                   <- "Remove Cumin" (origin/master)

So ANSWERS :
Before git fetch :
  your git origin/master should show
    - Add Chili Recipe
  your status should be
    - Ahead

After gif fetch :
  Your git origin/master should show
    - Remove Cumin
  your status should be
    - out of sync

/////////////////////////
git diff origin/master master <~ origin/master : fetched branch
