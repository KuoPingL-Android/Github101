Collaborating using GitHub
Let's say you and Sarah collaborate in a repository.

You have new changes that you want Sarah to check it out before merging
to the master branch :

a <- b <- c (master)
       <- new_Idea (different-oil)

You will use a feature in GitHub called "PULL REQUEST"
that make it easy for Sarah to know what have changed.

=========================
Your side :
git check -b different-oil
git add cake_recipe.txt
git commit
git push origin different-oil
==========================


On GitHub
Check on the Branch different-oil
You can click on the commit history to see what changes were made.

=========================
PULL REQUEST (your side)
on the main page, you can either click "compare & pull request" or

go to different-oil branch and click on "PULL REQUEST"

By default,
GitHub assumes you want to merge your changes to the Original repository
(Larry's repository).

You can change it back to your own repository by clicking "EDIT" on the right.

You can now change the BASE FORK to your repository.

Then click on Create PULL REQUEST.

==========================

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
PULL REQUEST (Sarah)
This is asking Sarah to pull Caroline's branch into the MASTER branch.

Here you can either give a comment overall or an inline comment.

If everything is go,
you can press on the MERGE PULL REQUEST.
(only go through without a Conflict)

===================================================
Commit merging a pull request
