Syncing Repositories
- Involved Syncing between the repository on your computer and the
  version hosted on Github.
- When using Github, you need to choose when and how to get the
  two versions in sync
- If Github automatically commit, you might end up making things public
  before they are ready.

So how do you set up a Github ?
- git clone requires a remote repository to begin with.
- so we need to prepare a repository on Github.

What kinds of interactions can you have with a remote?
- push / pull
- instead of selecting each individual commit,
  the most common way to send and receive data is by
  specifying a BRANCH

- so you can PUSH commit from master,
  since the rest can be reached from master tip,
  to the remote repository.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
Example :
Local :
a3b <- fd2 <- e53 (master)
           <- 6b4

Remote :
a3b

If I were to push the master branch, which commits would it push ?
Answer : fd2 , e53

a3b : Already available on Remote, no point to push.
6b4 : Not reachable from master branch
