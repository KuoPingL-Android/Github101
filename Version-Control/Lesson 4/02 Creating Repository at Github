Now, we need to create a repository at Github

1.
Add a Repository at your Github, don't initialize it with README.md or license.

2.
Go to your directory

3.
git init

4.
git remote add origin <url>
origin <~ this can be any name within this repository
          to refer to the repository on Github
          If you only have 1 remote, it's standard to name it origin.

git remote -v <~ verbose, means that git remote will output more info,
                 that is it will be more verbose.

5.
git push <remote> <local>
- remote <~ remote I want to send changes to
- local  <~ the name of the local branch that I'd like to push>


So in this case : git push origin master
