Forking Repository

============================
Tough way

Let's say, Larry has a repository that he is willing to share with
Caroline and Sarah.

1.
git clone larry_remote <~ to Caroline's origin

2.
git push caroline_origin <~ to shared master

3.
git clone shared_remote <~ to Sarah's origin
===============================


===============================
Forking
- with a single click
- is just like cloning but on Github's side of machine.


Side Effects :
- Github keeping track on NUMBER of forking, BY WHOM forking is done,
  also it all LINKs back to the original
