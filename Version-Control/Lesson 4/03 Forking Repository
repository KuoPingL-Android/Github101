Forking Repository

============================
Tough way

Let's say, Larry has a repository that he is willing to share with
Caroline and Sarah.

1.
git clone larry_remote <~ to Caroline's origin

2.
git push caroline_origin <~ to shared master

3.
git clone shared_remote <~ to Sarah's origin
===============================


===============================
Forking
- with a single click
- is just like cloning but on Github's side of machine.


Side Effects :
- Github keeping track on NUMBER of forking, BY WHOM forking is done,
  also it all LINKs back to the original

Pros :
- Easier to suggest changes back to the original repository.

================================

Q :
Where was your commit presented ?
Right before you ran git push, where do you think your commit adding
a new recipe was present ?
- Local

Similarly now that you have run git push, where do you think this
commit is present?
- Local & Fork

NOTE :
Running git push won't change what shows up in your local git log
- it will only change what is present on the remote.
